Q1 . What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

Q2 . Difference Between AI, ML, DL, Data Science
| Aspect  | AI                            | ML                                | DL                                      | Data Science                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| What?   | Any machine doing smart tasks | Subset of AI that learns patterns | Subset of ML using deep neural networks | Uses ML + Stats + Domain Knowledge |
| Example | Chess robot                   | Email spam filter                 | Self-driving car perception             | Analyzing customer churn           |

### Q3 . Linear Regression
A supervised ML algorithm that finds the best-fit straight line to predict a continuous target variable based on input features.
Equation: Y = wX + b
Goal: Minimize error (MSE) using gradient descent.
